# Lelantos Smart Contract
A Blockchain-based Anonymous Physical Delivery System
## Test Case
### Deployment Lelantos smart contract Using [Remix-Solidity IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljsonv0.4.11+commit.68ef5810.js&optimize=true)
* Remix-Solidity IDE  is a browser-based Solidity compiler and IDE. It also creates private blockchian for testing purpose.
* Upload Lelantos smart contract to Remix-Solidity IDE
* From the right side of Remix-Solidity IDE, select "Contract". You will find textbox to enter _**max_hop_fee**_  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhgharieb/Lelantos-Smart-Contract/master/images/deploy.png)

     Assuming that _**max_hop_fee**_ is 1 ETH (= 1000000000000000000 Wei)

     _**Deployment Input**_: `"1000000000000000000"`

   After Deployment step (Pressing _Create_), we can get the address of Lelantos Smart Contract L<sub>sc</sub> on the blockchain

### Scenario
A customer *C* wants to purchase a product (product ID `123456789`) from a merchant *M*. The *price* of the product is `2 ETH`. The customer wants to receive the product through **3** delivery companies.

#### Customer *App<sub>c<sub>* Calculation

* Choose 3 random tracking number *tn<sub>i<sub>* and calculate thier corresponding SHA3()
   
|i|*tn<sub>i<sub>*       |*trackingComm* = SHA3(*tn<sub>i<sub>*)|

* Choose 3 delivary companies, get their long term public key _pk<sub>i</sub>_ and caluclate _**c<sub>i</sub>**_ based on the equation  
_**c<sub>i</sub> = Enc<sub>pk<sub>i</sub></sub>(tn<sub>i</sub> , L<sub>sc</sub> , add<sub>next<sub>dc</sub></sub> âŠ• mask<sub>i</sub>)**_ where
     * add<sub>next<sub>dc</sub></sub>: the address of delivary company _i+1_ on route
     * mask<sub>i</sub>: random masking value
